# Image-Gradient-and-Edge-Detection-in-Image-Processing

This project, "Image Gradient and Edge Detection in Image Processingâ€œ, focuses on detecting edges in images by analyzing changes in color or brightness (gradients). Edge detection highlights boundaries and shapes, helping in tasks like object recognition and image analysis. We explore techniques like Laplacian, Sobel, and Canny Edge Detection to find and enhance these edges.

Used Tools : 
Language 
1) Python

Tools :
1) Vscode 
2) Spyder

Purpose of project :
1) Understand and apply edge detection techniques to identify shapes and boundaries in images.
2) Analyze image gradients (changes in brightness or color) to highlight important areas.
3) Enhance object recognition by making edges and contours more visible.

Methods Used in This Project :
1) Laplacian Edge Detection: Finds edges by calculating second-order changes in intensity.
2) Sobel Edge Detection (X and Y): Finds edges by detecting changes in specific directions (vertical and horizontal).
3) Canny Edge Detection: A refined, multi-step edge detection method for precise edge detection.
4) Converts an image to a simple black and white (binary) format to make edges clearer.

So, This project showed how image gradients and edge detection help highlight boundaries and details in images. Canny Edge Detection proved the most accurate, making it ideal for applications like object recognition and medical imaging, where clear edges are essential for precise analysis.
